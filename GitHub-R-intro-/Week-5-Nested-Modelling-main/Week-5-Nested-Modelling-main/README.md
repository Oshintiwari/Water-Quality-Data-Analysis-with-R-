# Week 5: Nesting and Modelling

## Goals

This week you will be working with a new dataset, some water quality data retrieved using the `dataRetrieval` R package. The first lesson works through importing and cleaning/tidying this data, and the second lesson dives into trend analysis and how you can `nest()` your data to apply a trend model to numerous sites and parameters all at once.

## Assignment

Remember to first **Fork** this repository and then **clone your forked repo**, and save copies of each .Rmd with *your name* appended to the file name. There are two lesson plans that must be completed for this week's assignment, in order:

1.  **01_Tidying_WQ_data.Rmd** -- No videos!
2.  **02_Modelling_WQ_data.Rmd** -- [Video 1](https://youtu.be/9V_Ks6phFWQ) + [Video 2](https://youtu.be/rVeRSBk5Xlg)

### Submission:

To submit your assignment, remember to push all your file edits to GitHub and then **submit a pull request** by clicking 'Contribute' -\> 'Open a Pull Request' from the homepage of *your* forked repo. The two assignments above are due by the end of the day **Monday 11/20**.
