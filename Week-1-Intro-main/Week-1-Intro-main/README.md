# Week 1: Introduction to Git, GitHub and RStudio

## Goals

This week you will be introduced to the course and learn how to use Git and GitHub with RStudio, as these are fundamental tools for version control and collaboration for data scientists. You will learn how to create your own GitHub repositories, write some code locally and practice committing and pushing your changes to GitHub, and practice collaborating with others via issues and pull requests.

## Resources

In addition to this week's lesson content, here are some useful and recommended resources for getting started with coding in R: - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (second edition) - [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) - [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/): Lots of useful links for beginners on this page - [Interactive tutorials from Posit (formerly RStudio)](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers): These tutorials were made using the `learnr` package and allow you to run R code directly from your browser

## Material/Assignment

1.  Start with the [intro-basics](https://github.com/Env-Data-Sci-FA23/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-basics.md) lesson, follow the instructions to create a GitHub repository and finish working through the lesson (*optional*), and commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository when you're done.

2.  **Carefully** read through the instructions in the 'exercise_YOURNAME.Rmd' to complete the second part of this week's assignment material.

Use the [git_github_fundamentals](https://github.com/Env-Data-Sci-FA23/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/git_github_fundamentals.md) as a resource throughout the course (and after!) for terminal commands, git commands, and collaborating on GitHub.

**To fully complete this week's assignment:**

-   Got to the [**Issues**](https://github.com/Env-Data-Sci-FA23/Week-1-Intro/issues) tab in this repository and add a comment with the link to the repository you made on your personal GitHub account you made as a part of the 'intro-basics' lesson. We will check to see that you successfully pushed some local code/files to GitHub.
-   Second, **carefully** follow the instructions in 'exercise_YOURNAME.Rmd' to fork/sync the class Week-1-Intro repo, work through the coding exercise (*to the best of your ability, completion/accuracy is not required*), submit a pull request and request a review by your assigned reviewer in 'PR_reviewer_assignments', and then **complete** and approve (do NOT merge) the pull request you were assigned.

**Due: End of the day Monday 10/23**
