# Week 3: APIs, Functions, and Iteration

## **Goals**

In this lesson, you will be learning how to pull in online data sets through the use of APIs, how to create your own functions, and how to iterate over a vector with `for` loops and `map()`. Next, you will learn how to explore data with collating, interactive plotting, and other tidying/organizing techniques.

## **Assignment**

There are two R Markdown lessons (01_api-funct-iter, 02_data-wrangling) that must be completed by the due date. Moreover, the following YouTube videos highlight concepts found in each lesson as follows:

**01_api-funct-iter.Rmd**: [*APIs*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmF6vknRVXY); [*Functions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XHmQY3vTI); [*Iterations*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_BUkIqtuUQ&t=234s)*.* It is important that you watch these in this order - they build off of each other! Together, these videos take about 30 minutes to watch.

**02_data-wrangling.Rmd**: [*Data wrangling*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHIWe7Vo8A)*.* This assignment and its associated video build off of what is learned in 01_api-funct-iter. Please start working on this piece *after* completing that first assignment. The YouTube video is a little over 15 minutes.

First fork then clone this repo, lastly copy/rename each Rmd assignment with your name. After completing the exercises, submit your updated repo as a pull request by the end of **Monday, 11/6**.

As a reminder... it's okay if you push multiple versions of code/documents to GitHub, even after you submit a pull request! It will just automatically update your pull request.

Happy coding! :-)
