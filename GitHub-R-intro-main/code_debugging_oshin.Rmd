## The Assignment:

*Tip: View this in the visual editor in RStudio*

You want to re-create the HTML document in the `lessons/` folder in this repo titled `code_debugging_output.html`. Below is the workflow to do so, ***however*** you will notice if you attempt to render this R Markdown document as is it does NOT reproduce the `code_debugging_output.html` file, and won't even render until you fix some of the mistakes/missing elements. Therefore, this workflow is not reproducible! Your task is to fix the below coding workflow so that it renders and **exactly** matches the output of `code_debugging_output.html` (*including* whether or not certain code chunks and/or outputs are shown).

There are a total of **5 fixes** you need to make to the workflow below. To complete this assignment you must ***1)*** Identify the 5 errors and specify what they are below (*4 pts each*) and ***2)*** fix the errors and render this entire .Rmd as am HTML doc where the content below matches that of the `code_debugging_output.html` (*5 pts*).

**List here the 5 errors you had to fix in this workflow:**


1.   Error in penguins %>% ggplot() : could not find function "%>%". Reason: tidyverse library not installed, which includes dplyr, ggplot2, and other related packages.

2.  Error: data set ‘penguins’ not found. Reason: 'palmerpenguins' package not installed and loaded.

3.  Data points are not distinguished by species. Updated code snippet( x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species) adds color to differentiate the data points by species

4.  Error: object 'adelie' not found. Reason: Spelling mistake in "species == 'Adelei'" , should be 'Adelie'

5. " adelie %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = island, y = body_mass_g))"
  
   This code chunk attempts to create a boxplot for the 'Adelie' species. However, there is     an issue with the object name 'adelie' because it's not defined earlier in the document. 

## The workflow you need to fix begins here:

In this workflow, we want to explore the Palmer Penguins data set collected at the Palmer Station LTER in Antarctica. This data is stored in the {palmerpenguins} data package.

We read in the data and initially explore its structure:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```


```{r}
data("penguins")
summary(penguins)
```

Let's first explore body mass among all the penguin species with a histogram:


```{r warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = body_mass_g))
```

Now we want to visualize the relationship between body mass and bill length *among species*:

```{r warning=FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species))
```

Finally, let's create a new data frame called `adelie` that contains data for just the *Adelie* penguin species, and then visualize the differences in that species' body mass among islands.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == 'Adelie')
```
```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == 'Adelie') %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = island, y = body_mass_g))
```

This figure suggests *Adelie* individuals on the Dream island are slightly smaller that those on the Biscoe and Torgersen islands.
